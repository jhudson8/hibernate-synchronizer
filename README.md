## Description

Hibernate Synchronizer is a free Eclipse plugin code generation tool to be used with the Hibernate persistence framework. The plugin will automatically generate java code when your hibernate mapping files are modified. Objects are created with generated code in an abstract base class and a user-modifiable extension class so user code does not get deleted when the generation is performed. 
The automaticallly generated objects include:

- Value Objects
- Proxy Interfaces
- Composite Key Objects
- Enumeration Objects
- Component Objects
- Subclasses
- DAOs

Other features include:
- Editor with code assist and outline view
- Custom template generation
- New mapping file wizard that queries your database
- New configuration file wizard
- Actions for adding mapping references, synchronizing files, and manually activating code generation
